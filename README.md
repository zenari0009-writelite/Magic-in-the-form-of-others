magic: in the form of others.
Zenari gazed down the icy tunnel in the prescence defereing the ulitmatium of choice he wraped his head around the detour. in the midst of oposing thought he'd never spy on olfuin training but the tunell was ling and olfuins sumon was there. " are you going to jump zenari.. it;s a ice shute and you have no way of sliding down. .
an excerpt form a part in the book that delays the inspired. to turn to the skeptic.
(redirect the notice of alarm to something that is cast in the night.” 
Hold the debris or walk away a different person.”
This is the final delivery of welfare for our home.”)

Amidst the dream the clumsy yet admired young man known as Dloetni. Woke to the sound of home and midst the fire of his family . as he wandered throughout the house half awake the man known as freoiun his admirable and sophisticated father was the head of the household. “Did it happen again.” no Father.” it was just another night's sweat from the terror of assignment next week. 
“ the hunt for a creature the size of a ghoul. Next to the midnight hour he will transparently be found marching the field in the midst of the network of trees. The creature is frightening and has startled many villagers in the trials of men.  In the powers  of our town. Named  Teris.
The fiend must die father for it has no right to approve the nature of the forest.
For it;s time to feast on the frightened has ended the terrain of our youth. 

Charisma will not save it from death. 
The character of our old nobility on your shoulders Dloetni no pace forward and become the man your destined to be. Not the title but for my family!

Dloentni marched out and became the hero in the eyes of the townsmen and soon rewrote the mechanisms of art and hunting culture his arms and leg span far exceeded his sprint though.rewound in  the fields of his shoulders he reached for point. As soon as he shot the grove past the meadows and into the fields. 
Teris was found marching the hills  and feasting on something in the distance..


The hour had struck and he plucked up his drawback and fired, moving the heel of Teris into the right lung:; and puncturing till blood flew from its mouth.pouring the teris creature shrieked and said out of it;s mouth  a lighting spark in the sky. As soon as Dloetni saw the beast die he grabbed his things as a calm sense said only to take a tooth as a reward from the monster, dead on the ground. 

Moving networks back to his home town called Eros with his father and mother, and family he started to sing a tune. “Oh how a creature can cast fright , good day last night.” Dloteni clicked his arm guards to the sound. And rushed forward to grab him with congratulatory arms. Their wa sno body left of the Teris for it dissapated.  They were ecstatic as ever to hear that the creature was gone forever and that it was time for the festival to begin for the new parties. Dloetni was fixated upon a beautiful woman whose touch was said to heal the frost of life. He approached and said “how fair lady?” the women replied oh the ender of the teris above which natures shows their end anyway making them the leastof all creatures a dance tonight.” as he danced upon the yard he resumed dancing and felt the freedom of his night far beyond words he could express. The needs he felt about a second which for some reason she declined and stepped aside.” the guards were drinking and playing games and as he headed outside he asked if he could join in on the game . Sure they played a lesser game but still developed to enjoy his time. As the game rules go. No cheating” then he asked for the rules they said just play and they’ll help. As soon as they started they enjoyed the night game and said he was eventually too tired to play the rest. 
He arrove at home stumbling and found his way to the couch where he could rest and retire.
The dreams you have tonight may they be fair and the rest of your days grand. His sister said and father. 
TERIS….!
He awoke the next morning startled from the confusion of the dream how horrifying it had been to fulfil the attempt at shut eye.
A creature is nothing like my son. He;s grown and now is abe to enjoy the night and day with his father step outside with me and fill the full effects of what it is to be a man. Now grab a sword and pay attention. I like the bow more father and the sword is heavier.. No-no pick it up.all in good cheer. As soon as he did he felt well in his hands and tired in his body yet the practice to win the event was full of charm him vs. his father the gate champion as soon as he swung the sword the armament bounced off the hilt and cling. They struck as soon as the teo met in the instant he felt the fling of a nasty blow then he jounced up and took the father by surprise with his next attack and realized he needed to motion down as he went to pick up his father he noticed the anger in his eyes saying stand away from me and get some more practice tomorrow. 
Resting near the river that ran through the woods he found the music from town had changed to a more aggressive song and wondered if his father was ok. 
Interested in the sound of his lungs he felt that he would retire later to the house from his mom’s house who had passed on somehow and no none really explained.

Father, how did mom pass away. 
Well son that varies on the distance we travel and the sound of the air in our hearts,’
She was attacked by maybe 12 bad people and fought she did but they never got the best of her as we arrived an arrow struck her the heart and dropped her to the ground.
Have you seen the time.”

I haven’t got the time but the story is intense in the fact of the death of our mother.
Relax and take the night easy for it will be another day tomorrow perhaps a great year.
Finally a great year of peace and rest. Skirmish again tomorrow. Nay
A swordsman of my calibur could change the fate of many.”
The second day turned around the notion that his welcoming was far beyond the level he had expected. In the surrounding areas they just followed in to meet the young adventurers and surprise him with gifts and multiple things for his accomplishment.of destroying the creature. He decided to un down to the field with his sister for their meeting. New fields soon, and they last a live time because you took out that creature. Soon they followed to the market and as soon as they sw him everyone cheered his name dloetni. Our hero,” now in the thoughts of your hard work,”  may you manage the fields well and grow into a young warrior for you are the …

After about an hour of cheer thousands greeted him with the same chant. They then sought out where he;d go to school and how he’d be able to present himself the next store leader.” 

Taking a bag of washable clothes the curious dloenti began walking past his friend from the village grrimnor. Girmnor” “ dont panic on the subject of life or death is what father told me so i think i’m doing well.” five minutes and doen.” as grimnor left the scene with his bag full of clothes asking only one question. “Worried?. the n in the midst a woman walked by and sias now time to leave doeltni and move forward.  
As soon as the space opened up next to his fathers house he received a glance at a women moving in from the dance next door as well. She swept in and waved at him and rested in the room of her own with her parents. Doeltni then rose form the area of his seat to grab the food next to him.  Focused on the direction of the sword given to him and the bow that shot the 
Teris. Feeling sick he reclined back in the bed and fell asleep. 
“Teris….
A…day or night.”

Wking up to his father sight he said he was feeling anxious about the fight with the teris and wanted to connect with more people outdoors. Grasping his sword his father said to follow him outside. To spare again. Dreams…” none. His gaze dropped as he returned the young man back to his sparing yard and studied the messages of a true spar .
Pace took over his body and it clung with fierceness a sort of fear never fled his heart about being struck. Then in the commotion of crossed swords and blades doelntni beat his father again. With great strength he overturned him and fumbled to help him up once again.. Could be 2 more years left til you become our manager in the store. 
Sports i need to play a sport of some kind water or dirt ground sport father what do you reply with..? The next tree game in the roots of career are called the announcing game of energetic stocking exchange. 
Try not to underestimate the other players it;s your sister and the night before you go to the travels of the elderly to make yourself known, find the game relaxing and send a message to the sport for the instincts of the world to decide victors.
The game review on the last few i have them and am ready to make the people have greater times in the least of your worries. Have fun.” moving forward he approached the office held by the sports elders and started the assigning process. 
The sport known as elaida wa in the perceptual of the notice of intrigue by his understanding. As he advanced through the game he became more entwisted by it’s vigorous details. Participants in the game bi annual summations had the greater hold the honoruable,,reputable spot. Neglect filled his heart with ignorance yet the feeling was bliss. As he started to enjoy the inevitable defeat he felt assured it would not end his nuance,” Confidence won;t help you Deoltni.” then said; “ambition is not the goal but the disenchanted.” as they fell to the lore of the game the proceedings felt the oversurpass of initial clause,. Then the beginning of the flag raised the vitality of the opposing game. “

Then in the apparent disaster of his clumsiness he lost the whole lance. Reputable loss he suited home to find that his father was brewing the annual drink of  water tangible collection of alcoholic substances. .
He tried every gulp down.”
Then in the night of the game with the guards he humorously attended them again,

Dream note.”

“ TEris teris.. Can you here me”
Yes..”
Then run to the hills for the people around you are trying to eliminate you.”
Teris..?
“ then the message is clear that you did not fall to the arrow.”
Fear is all you have but the irrelevant to the length of life you have,”
Tomorrow, run the games.”
The run the influence higher to the aggeressor but always lose for winning is your price”
“The women is deceit in a glance but not trusted for the daylight.”
Regret not the assumption of your knees but the strength of your ankles. Clumsy.”
Anything else.? 
Run for tomorrow you will fall to the sword of your father.”
No. error is mine.
I don’t want to die teris.? Would you swiftly aid me.?
The aid is yours with a guide. The sword falls at 12:00pm yet the rest is in the hand of requirements.?
I have no aid not even one yet how do you defeat this nightmare.?
Review the message in your head. Code?...
The next morning just as Deolnti woke up his strength wasn’t their. His fathe rsaid today we go to the morning sun and make the prepertaitons for your village stay “ Father the night is rogressed with more activities. :” aye me boy yet the field is needed of more discreetet things.
Continuing on the journey and let me grasp my things and catch up. “ 4 minutes remai before you need worry about the sunlight advances. Bring forth the ease of backpack and mutual scholarly and meet me in the oak tree( though not oak it’s a horrifying tree for the end of the ceremony was found their.” 
Pack your things boy 4 mins. ..
Tree distance was found to be 120 feet from the house, full of vigor hiss father stood valiantly towards the tree of furthermore. Speculations … he would not survive this. Higher thoughts progressed in doelnti nearly 60 feet towards it swept kicked his father. Trusting in Teris guidance and formulating the best plan possible ran to the darkest sight of the sun fleeing into the woods for he heard the sord cling anyways and hid in a spot next to the old ravine opposite the hills. 
Embracing the evening glow of sight. Soon he had the requirements to the next situation of environments.” screams of terror echoed from the tree but he didn’t know where from. For they changed in a moments glance at a certain time into the terrifying of creatures. 
.’ screams.. Not like anything I’ve ever heard before, my ears are deafened to the canal.” the intensive scurrying and destruction lead me to believe the first dream was evident in the function in the resurfacing of imagination.loading tangibles into the mundane of rocks and boulders. Although the fathomable of attendants had not arrived into his life known as teris. Both legs fine from some magical force and growing into the definitive body . leap. Was the thrill and living is the experience now where is teris in the graphics of the commotion. Negiblle hints led the wary to a cave where he found the beginning of a survival. 
TERis…. Are you here.’ 
Eros. is your name and i’m over the game you survived now … what do you need.
The survival of my true family. 
Chapter 2.

A glance at 10 days was  a hard understanding but Teris  was a speialist at making someone aware to the future. Perspective is short of perfection TERis.? 
“ the journey through your mind is a perception to hold onto.”
As he paced the walls of the cave and looked deeper into it each day he felt the growth of knowing if someone wsaa nearby or not. Tapping his boots he sat on the ground and began asking questions on the future.”’
“ how many todday teris.”
Aquainted with ffear of the fact it could be today someone finds him. 
“The cave is set to exit but the paths of life unure.”
Find the center of your bow knotch this morning at sunset,.
Claim the air or fight the dust.

Climbing with teris nearyby she jumped on his shoulder to begin the frienship of tackling a cave explorartion. As they continued into the dark teris saw the light on the other side of the cave.they began jumping in their chests for the chance to be out of the cave and near food. “ his supply bag was ditched so he drank and ate only from what was in the cave, Teris was almost out before him leaping forward and such to the edge of the cliff. When dleotni felt the rumble beneath him and jumped out too. Looking down he saw some of the ones who;d been playing the eldia game. Fear gripped his heart and teris line kick in find the knotch at sunset . with only 12 seconds before sunset he rester his bow forward and waited. 1…2…4…6…7…9..12.. Releasing the arrow hitting the side of the cave rock and pummeling down then in a turn he began to run with teris watching the opening close within the cave, crushing his oponents.
Knowing that no one could cross the ravine and the cave didn;t slow his running until he saw teris weaken. In pace…  is this the teris i shot.?”
No.
I can;t begin to imagine that my friend i saved had almost lost it;s life to my own arrow.later catching his breath he picked up teris and headed into the forest of musky break to find a river of water. Teris half asleep full of enthriving glee smiled as he held her he looked for a wound but found none on it’s body..
[Breep.” the breath of a teris animals sound like this when they sleep] 
Sleep she did until the loss of the day and night cycles could find them by the ever to enjoy a water day and rest from terrible beings, teris jumped in the water full of happiness , swimming for almost two hours. 
Rivers and streams are tied to the connection of dreams and imaginations. What do you think safely can we stay here the night “Teris”,
“Where ties to how you use it?:
“The night grows colder, and the feet of many surround, the sounds of roaring thunder yet none but you.?”
“seek not the slumber,seek the awakening.”
As Dlontri set his eyes to the faten scared at first and wondering what it meant to be trapped in thought, thunder?” 
Teris”, teris,”
Colder.?
“Teris,Teris.
“You can only answer one question a day or night?”
Then motivated that he was right he set his knapsack out to watch the night events of stars and moonlight, falling ever so knittly Teris jumped next to his shoulder and then landed on it.
Putting dloentri to sleep. In the comfort of Teris being by his side. As he slumbered he was awoken by the sound of thunder and then the sound of colder wind. Seeing the faces of men and women who wanted to talk to him about the feelings of emotions flying around in him . 
Who…?”
Knightly in gesture was the appearance of lightning in her eyes.
Shooked by terror dloenti moved back four footsteps. In the midst of his courage he could barely muster. Where did you arrive from?
The women said in her vesture “ Teris.” then continued “ how have you been in the midst of separation.” 
“ Do you two know each other?”  dlontri said . nowmore in thought about how teris had saved his life. “ wondering if this would be the moment he was left behind without any help. “ Teris and I actually go way back to the times before the options of what lies now. “Your both ancient and have matter si in the land of the living mortals.? “
Not necessarily shy then  normally did she move with the night sky. In he moment of the deepest part of his thoughts she caught him off guard with speech…. Teris … is found of you but losing interest in your thoughts. What is it that brought out the side between you two. Well i ugh the start of the matter is Teris . is a great friend. I…  just don’t know the subtitles of how it goes.. She is not the under dog here you are and lost in movement for the start of your losses are not the breaking of a new friendship… and i know about the arrow. It;s the beginning of the ideal for the new companionship you may earn by getting her trust back. Sorry  i  didn’t mean to lie but the thought of unfriendly gestures in communication for under clumsiness  the moment we integrity we lose the fight. Rebuild where you like to be but in the reflections you lose the character that enables us the introduction to newer life. Now did you shoot Teris with an arrow?! Yes, well i've spent my time I lose.”..no silence she took his hand with tears and said i owe you a debt for the truth.  Teris is a gentle creature and to escape what you did moves my body to feeling untranquil. In the midst of our new friendship may the  ancients smile upon you in the hopes we will make a stand against these things whatever they may be… i hat speaking about them i hate talking about them more i cringe in sudden shock because i can’t protect you from one.as he hit the realization he asked only one question who to fear?
The one from the known as elza osc. The terrifying creature cannot be stopped and was the worst thing in the world to touch soil. His speed was furious and his blade scary.
In this midst I felt that the chest of my heart can;t bear another loss. My whole family full of life gone due to these creatures, 
Can you lift us off this powerless state of tracing stars.. Staring into her eyes he saw the blue wilds fair and amiss with fear, I.. can beat them. 
Then stand with me and face the endurance test of ages. Just to warm up.. Standing at his feet as many rose him up (though not there yet), intrigued in the midst of what he was talking about her garments quickly changed into an armor suit. In the vestibule. The night filled with the sound of thunder. One lap… 300.. Lap she was done pretending. And put the speed on him enduring the saints he was still at 29 laps but she passed him to lap 20 more. 

“The ancients if summoned might be able to help
Wind in the sail is different then wind in the wave cursor
In spite of luck there is only skill.”
When he awoke to the song of morning birds , she was gone. Teris where is she…?
“The only answer we know is far happier the night to see you then the morning after.”
Tonight was the night i was going to ask her about the ancients and the rite of magical passage to claim the win over the present life. Humiliated at my defeat is not true. It is true that you are greater in speed what am i to do today. As his hand fell backwards there was a book called summons of magic. His heart raced with the idea she would reappear in the future.  Studying he sent out messages to teris that if he could fix their friendship he would restore it one day.
Teris knew the question would pop up and then just answered 
“ friendship reliance and structure,”
“You’ll be fine with the new division on the way,”
No jump today but page 89.”
The book he held in his hand said the words ancient magi . he opened the pages and started reading the cover.. Multiple ranges in the arts of elements and the arts of mdyril. The beginning of the book floated the pages with the excellent nature to teach him for his next encounter defined in the areas of diagrams and page squares. I know how to read teris.. This is time well earned right. Lightning spark. As it glow at his fingers he saw the evidence of the ancients' olden ways..in the silence he sat under the remarks of his own abilities to master the ranges and diagrams.. Teris” can the book change,? Teris teris.. Oh your still tired in the day i’ll ask tonight for the new questions, in the mishap of studying page five fire elements  he tried to learn the infero shield and cast it to the best of his abilities … one .. two.. Three… swarming with immense heat the inferno began to blaze around his whole being then in the midst of elaborate movements the shield was brought forth only fifth try.  To face the heat of an inferno is to face the blaze of  seeked out focus of flame.”
Amidst the hours of studies he put into the book dlenoti. “ cursed are the figures of the words you speek which is your name.:” d..l..e..o.n.t.i is not the name you were given spark… is close but read and develop the interest. As he shuddered in embarrassment night had begun to fall on the land of valstorm. Were he was situated in the midst of trying to study more then jumped teris.? 
Questions later for the test is the day of beginnings so hurry.
For the new journey is ahead and beyond the journey is the ending
So put forth your task and set it unto the east or west but fleets could make a home safe.

Safety fell his body for an army that size could destroy us and make us without life.. Where does it come from. Whose is it that belongs to the size of giants that could stop a fleet of people in the midst of masses. Where are the giants.?

Where are giants,?

The giants are east wards towards the mountainous ranges right or westward toward the ocean.
As the advancement of his paces quickened he felt the range of oceans towards the east and mountains towards the west. Speicficallly the gaze of a giant is a mystery for him to find such a creature and return it to his fleets…
Pause.. And find the center of gravity within yourself towards north…
As he ran the courtyards and up towards the direction he wanted he started sprinting and using magic to the heights of what would be believed nominal. 
As the speed endured his body he ran up to the northern gates ut was freezing so had to change pace. Opening his book he began to read the arts and crafts of literature. To see if there was a way to stop freezing in the body. 
Magic arts on surviving frost usually take years to master. Giants however survive the details with blodd that is sealed to temps. In the forest and from the flames is the tales of beast that are far superior in strength in the warmth of the sun yet none know the reaches of their power in the frozen lands. Surviving in the snow is an altered effect it requires a time limit.. 2..3 days but some have pushed to 10 days without the use of leaving . 
Focus on feet or hands. In your body then stove forward tile the effect begins to alter reaching within yourself the ability to push through the snow  and chills… usually means the freezing cold is attempting to take over the divided stance of you iclelian glands,. Onton the graphs of reflection you;ll find no one passes first try most the time. 
Focusing his muscles he brought forth the ability but it was not first time that he tried tht he fully understood what he was talking about. Motioning forward on his 6th try 7th then finally the 9th.
He achieved the alter effect and felt the peace in freezing instead of the chills.



Giants roam the land looking for food and now the net of gains to derive there hunger in the food of fish. As they lingered at the pools for food in the wells of exchange of fish they began to alter the weather to let the boy in..
Matching the pace of nothing able to derive his sense. He began to fill his bucket  of water with the respondence in the unnatural fields . water and evidence of gulping the freezing glaciers peak he lifted his bucket.. Woah woah now little one the fluids of that glacier belong to me and my family.then i won;t take the bucket. Nearer… 
Congratulations you;ve passed you;ve never robbed a giant his due we’ll get you a job and food.
As he shuffled forward he felt the entangling of no ropes and responsibility filled his mind.  The giants knew the answer and were gifted with the exchange of utterly showing him magic that could help him down the road. Magic lifting and magical options in the sight of the things that lead to wild introspections. They like him as a person but since he was not a giant headed  into the fields to find his new home.
In the fields he discovered some trees. “Shaping magic”













Chapter 3  a forest called home.

As the boy journeyed into the night sky after his friendly night sky, after his associates the giants, he ventured south eastward. The children of the giants taught him the strength to fashion his forces togetherly but he had no one to train. They said it would be easier to follow  towards the south east or the nightmares would continue in their little friend, they heeded that he be ready for a fight in about 16 days, or so. 
The book spoke to him one more time that the nature of the woods would be great ground to start the night air and surface the terrain . a locator of some ideal on his enemies at all times to keep them away from him and his family. Non could fashion the evident that a device could store the solution to all their problems in the  gesture then it would conceal them no longer from the boy. 
As  he approached the way to travel by foot he asked the book if any such say of travel was volley but the book only listened to him. “What’s going on?”the evidence of my training and yet the book dimly replies. 
Zenari….
The book of magic… dim yet soft…
The boy miles away from the woods started elude. 
Boy…
Now please…
“ In the mist of your mind is the peculiar settings”
“Cognition Teris yet not the advantage of his oppression.”


Teris saw the maze and knew its sign.
As he swiftly declined an elf caught him.
Soon into the night the young lad woke to the sight of a fire…” Trembling inside this is the end they’ve caught me…” 
Teris.. Please one more message in dreams if you should
Teris! There is no need to send a message. You're safe. For if the forest is a maze they will not find you. 
Maze.?
Shorter the walk more frightening the evidence.
.”wait …I’m in a bed.”
Shortly after realizing he was in no harm he found a lantern lit with the symbols of mazes and objects he could not define. 
Desiring to receive the information of them in the midst of writing he felt more knowledgeable.
lines of insight triggered him wondering who wrote this.? 
In the specialty of languages was the design of a way to apprehend his mind for further constructs.midst the confusion of the entire languages. He found peace within himself. To establish the magic book more and to find the library would be his next move on where the book introduced itself.
.”The library would be a great place to start, it could even end there.”
Zenari!”
Teris!’”
How does the night sky dominion? “the realm to form the new day.?”Interesting as it is the night does not apprehend the sun it merely locates a new day,”
Who is the one to control the avenues of mind over solution.”Sorry you were shot at.
Thanks.

Train your instinct, to form the situation around what you want them to be like.? They live in the fields at night yet in the daylight they disguise themselves as shadow-like creatures or a new type of monster.
“Teris monsters are the equivalent of most time shadows.”
"knows this as well,he had a lot of training with the giants.”
“Giants are opposed to monsters; we'd have to get his knowledge on them higher.”
Todays course of knowledge is the know how on how to approach the specific fields of engineering the solutions.
Dloenti the fact you are cursed with the task ahead is easy to understand yet the notions of how you handle the situation is up to your abilities in magic. “Dloenti is my name right?”
“That’s the question he wanted to talk to you about later.” the girl with a lightning eye appearance. “ must be a dream.” 
“Zenari?”” “wouldn’t want to speak in the direction of mingling.”
“In the direction of our social skills is what mingling means.”
“Dloenti… is not my name right.?” then Zenari rushed over and said that his name would be lost in the space of the ruins at which his family died.grabbing his magic book dloenti picked up the back pack to and said then we go to where my family perished. As he continued down the avenue zenari and the girl spoke and said three or four. “Four, that’s the  number of a fitting edge.”
As dloenti reached into his back pack for the  book and prepared the notice that he was ready for trials the book then glowed and guided the steps of the boy next to Zenari. Teris and the girl communicated that the bold walk would be his greatest achievement . Standing next to an elf is a great achievement , but he doesn;t have the attire to turn into a man yet. Teris he’ll be fine he just needs the advantage of listening to the alterations of music near the restorative part of sound and it’’s guidance. “ Teris Teris…

Overconfidence is the illusion.of emn and the art of science for change. Magic has ther beliefs and makes man more puzzling advantages on a maze of interest,
“Secrets of the monster is he;s not intermixed with wrongdoing.” teris
Then we;ll have to find a way to compensate him,” finally a voice of nature.” not yours but still there.” introduce the new cycle of generations in your family and let loose the confidence you have this monster is different. I’ll be a man and last the clash.” zenari half wittedly said not likely.”
In my overconfidence comes the nature to win the fight. The girl replied that is not how you earn the name of a women as well is it.”? Yea.” ok..” rushing forward with anticipation to fight a monster he drew his bow once again. Time to dash forward and take down the monster.” he rushed forward toward the cave in the side of the mountain and began to react with haste. Who is brave is a disregard.” ROAR! So loud that it took the whole realm by surprise. Finally his bow almost raised he felt it tighten to his chest and soon he;d shoot …. Wait ..w ait teris.
Seems he thought of me first and not the arrow fly .
Proper settings on the bow for the strike,
Earning points.” 
Monster of old. A game for the faint to earn the title of being a clash. What game is it you wish to play coward. Language game or  i don’t know you decide  then take the game f languages first. Upscale the value of a vowel and what do you get. A consonant. Great your turn. OPTIRL what is this famous for,... zenari!.
What” 
Message me how i figured this out about him it means his past mission to get here. So you like him he;s been my hygenist for years. Not to tally but what game is yours. Tally!  Next in the generation is your turn. Literally is figures of what shadows bring is not what a creature could be it mus and would be light forming or task associated with split reactance and for that they must be crushed. Answer the title : the spontaneous book is named teris. Suggest the altercations foe and you see the edge of the blade: raise a hand and you have the deck full. Don;t mock the elegance of a women and she will not only crush you she;ll destroy your integrity. Whose desperate. Both said half aside. Next game two out of three means a no show. Attention the game is about to begin. List the name of people in the room and find the doctor nearby . cosmos relations. For the influence of the night is far stronger on the brighter side. In the great negligent or scares reputation.
Hit the right ticket and now the fun. The winner is both clearly and stated this means what guardianship of the boy correct in the problem of his addressing and this situation means he must move by day. Zenari low cast fireball please. One two three .. fireball. Move through the charts and echo throughout the spectrums in the chance to arrange the mediums . situation climbing in the peak of night now day. Run for if we don’t we’re done for onto the monsters back. They all jumped onto the monsters back full of timing and like swiftness they were gone . traveling as fast as the night shelter would give them they arrived to a new area full of moonlight. Faster than day and night. Unable to fathom the distance they all congrgulated the monster whose name is final or your back where you started. Zenari Teris girl with appearance in her eyes of lightning . be brave and you lose. Girl with the appaernce of lightning what is his name, thunder cast at her thought. must be Nigh-zabara.
Then you have spoken i;ll stay on this trip for it is fascinating as to how the next moments go. In thirty seconds the world weaned the giants fought and the day and they were obliterated to his sadness he must stay still for he was in the ruins of his families city.
What is this place"
the night sky bends towards the sun here.?"
Zenair this it the old twn ruins of the people of ashri the people of the town of ashri all vanished without site years ago.
volunti this is the town of ashri where you can find what it is oyou;ve been looking for
in a moment tears streamed down their faces as they looked away
next to the wlak of dlonetni a voice came in the thunder " be safe young one and know we are here for you
a helm a broken peice of armor and a bow unstrung next to a sword. 
this is all thet's left of these peoples garrison or barraks  then we;d better take it with us
as he reached for it magic shot out aroun dthe boys body.
hello son... it;s your parents. tears dripped past the unlogical new look of sadness on his face.
he bent donw lower to the ground asking to make it stop and the pain hurt him so bad he gripped his knees. 
ashri cry like that.
... don;t be afraid of the grouping in the mass and make sure to button oyur shirt. never shoot at an animal and don;t disrespect a fellow friend. within the circuit you make stay friendly to giants... your favorite. never lodse sight of the past and focus all your might to keep it. a ruined city could be yours one day... raise a fist in the game of life and show them you mean to win. your mother and i are proud of your survival the next thing is this... a life must be tken or it may be your own next time. train hard and solve the riddle we all know you will... we ashri aeior froior meloi ashri opadens. what is my real name.? olfuin. my son olfuin the bow without disaster. then ashri aeior froir meloi ashri to you too opadens. tears streaming down his face he felt the roar of a dragon nearby but felt scared then olfuin from now on. as he cried the star could not allign or rain on him so he begn his question do i get one more question? goodbye,son. as the bow and armor dissolved into magic the day wa s left to the night and began to make him wonder in .tears when they would dry. voltuni. so know that you know what is your name.?" olfuin.. bow without disaster. " well then bow without disaster what's the night sky do to the perceptions of how to cheer you up in a hour a storm or something greater." im in alot of pain hold on. as the sky settled around the bank he said a vortex. she asked zenari and then one was made to begin the nigntly watch for one hour.  then a lightning bold shattered the skies and zenari knew she had done it. 
zenari awoke the tow who slept next to eachother to begin the daily activities of finding a trades burough so they would earn money for food and training. 

Zenari." hven;t seen you here since you were younger nigh-barara, said to him and teris hasn;t taled to us since the days of yor youth what is the first step in awakeing the processes the children face. the enemy is stronger then most faster then others and able to reach towards the sky space for the intelligence. sound like the one you faced. 
not here not ever...

it;s no delusion that the odss of his victory is slim here, as the hidden guide my agenda or lesser quality work is to watch over hima and her til the pratical point issues point elswhere but life is a treasure to most,.. what did gildri say and nidri... idk the quailty of their relationship but they stated it would be like an edning of natural endings. the college after for the young ones if they win and private tutorships... 
nigh barara  maze the principle the student and th approach of underlying mechanics can he take the pain." no he can't he'll elude and already has this is the saddest thing i've ever watched.

as the bow dissolved in his hand s the armor and the helm...
Tears fell like rivers from his face for the ashri was all he had to be his family. crying tears of almost defeat he began to hit the floor to his knees.
(all these new friends.)
a broken city with non to aid us in our battle.)
(i'm the last of my people.)
as the child drew in air the thing he held most to was the face of the girl with lightning in her eyes. withput hestiation she took his hand.
he kept crying and couldn't hold the strengh to stand anymore and therefor as a man he hitch his clumsy side and dropped lower but before he reached the ground an elf appeared and helped him one more time and teris said goodnight. (he fainted then.)
 as soon as it was daylight the boy awoke still on his knees for some reason but never to ask the question of how>? 
his friends were eating and discussing him about to awaken and looked over saying to arrive over for food.
the city looked better in light so he felt better and moved slowly towards him in the daylight warmth.
"i know its hard but ask the magic book to carry you."
he asked the book too kinda slowly and advanced faster after it said a word he'd never heard before. 
darkness isn't going to hurt you either anymore with those word right it's zenari. approaching them in the daylight faster then he ws able to do on his own strength he began to feel lost in a network of faces and thought. (who is zenari really and why does the girl have better connections to him.) ive looked all over the place but wait the magic book. Who is zenari.... a weighty question zenari is the hidden guide of all realms. in exchange cast nothing at him but use magic to reduce your glow in the light... fine but what is repel or fade. it;s a old word but fade.. fade! as he started to disapear zenari entered his mind... that's the trick i would use everyday to practice better learning on sunlight in areas. thwho are you. who do you think i am? zenari is the one im trying to talk to about the realm and get a full understanding of who he is . could you maybe help me understand what he does for others... the girl is often seen eith me laughing and that troubles you? we've been friends for years and the only echo of laughter you should worry on is your own, sub categories are fantasies in your mind, enjoy them for they may care for you more then you think. enter into the world of reality for a minute i just lost my whole family how would i ever see them again, ashri was my family. i know that i was there in the fields watching. a gazer of stars or something else . use the book. telepathy is the endurance of the mind their are others what do you want to know. mind puzzles and games are telepathic and telekinesis is cotrolling the puzzle.


applications of the magical society of the apllied sciences was found to be the natural phantom in the mist of tremble. telpathy or telkenisis it is up to you but the study shows the reactions on your face that your going to say " telepathy." the mind corrected to the potential but with no limit to the abilitites then. face the challenge ahead and see that life is ... what did he choose.? " "telepathy." concepts to undersatnd the unknown greater telekinesis. matters of the opportunate. you've made your choice. what was the reasoning.?" to speak to the girl. secretly? yes zenari secretly. then move the forward motions i'll set another log in the constructs. then their ready to partake the task ahead right is nigh barara. yea you're right their most defintely ready fotr the next task.

chapter 4.) the maze of magic.

as the children were talking in the fields ,of not just their minds writing stories in the imagitive world. games of course to to keep the  occupied . zenari was using a book of magic he crafted since times before the battles that conculde in realms only. hidden is the space that we mostly wish to be soon for the creatures you saw will strike for you again. and further more the numbers grow greatly so after you must form the allagiance of all in the time of least. the goals of the projct is too find a safe place to hide. the ashri probably built building to the west right olfuin do you think we'll be safe there. nigh abrara has the mmovement speed again and if that;s a serious question we won't be safe there at all. Zenari " survive the night and we get to fight again in the realm for another time in the midst of the ancients. you earn that rite and you will win olfuin. steady your aim and pick up your boew after you tell teris sorry. sorry teris i have touse a bow again. 
(a shot at night against a future friendship
you should know two strikes are against you for the attempt to end.
ill move forward if you prove your a true ashri and answer this question
what is a realm with non to guide you alone yet still confident means what to yourself."
)
yes i know they are in appearance of creatures in only smes sight now be an ashri and see through their disguises when you are able,
not that phrase yet but study your own language, Olfuin opened the book and began to read on the subject of languages input in all that he had left for thenight saying it was a better option then his final breath.

the magic book lit up and said ashri... run to the maze with zenari. zenari stepped forward and siad where are we going.?" THE magic maze." in three steps we'll be there and the zenari  said a magic incantation and they vanihed with nigh barara. who took a different form in the maze . looking like a horned animal in the darkness and the maze they were in was crafty, designed and you  must engage  the traps. participate and don't be mad at me if you find the wrong end. we'll stay here the night ? you have to compete in it i'll be at the end. what" zenari zenari. as he moved he dissapeared in the maze at great speed. (choose now a guide.) hidden or in defense of a life. hidden and hidden. as they walked forward the animals stepped forward and guided them to their place in the maze start, they immediately asked their names .. the one of light said im the betrayer of your trust. oh .ok. the one of darkness said i'm the path to end but not where to truly locate. so the two asked one final questin is it a race . the light one said surely not. the darkness one said safe is untrue in the midst of two. as the ventured forward olfuin looked left and said we shouldn't seperate the girl with lightning of eyes. sadi but we must to cover more ground. as the sound of pesronal save draft>

in the land of the gods of olfuin people the nei-ashri. olfuin saw the coolness of summons and night time areana cast over the flor into the satr dome ,like, dome of the central forces then sce-nari asked the question "what? is the conste;ations is earthly the sums of oddities and so forth . can you relate to a topic of realms..." into the magic book and into the aparrel ," without that stuff olfuin fo the future of the endeavors is also wrong.in literature of realms. nei-ashri are the comoners of alot of things inrealms of boks. you shouldn;t ned the help of us to find the realtion in the brink of suces or the epilogue of failure. note the atention tho the rae of your family and find them if they are dead then we are at war with what destroyred them.
